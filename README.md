Challenge:
----------------------

Friend, you've got to help me out! I know you've been picking up knowledge of cybersecurity - I have an issue and could use your help.

I was looking at my database earlier today, and found an account with 9999999 crystals (which is one of the currencies in my game). It is impossible for them to get that number legitimately, that many crystals don't even exist in my game!

Can you look into it and see if you can find the hole through which this user obtained so many crystals? If you could duplicate the bug, I can fix it. A good place to start would likely be the Crystal Market on the Explore page. Feel free to explore the source code as well if that helps.

Thanks!
