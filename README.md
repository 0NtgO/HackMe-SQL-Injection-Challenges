Challenge:
----------------------

Thanks for your help on the last one friend - based on your analysis, I was able to duplicate the bug.

Before I had a chance to fix it though, I actually got a message from the hacker. His account had suddenly gone from level 1 to level 100, which should be impossible to attain in under a year.

In his message, the hacker said he used a bug in the crystal markets to update his user in the database. He told me I had 7 days to find and fix this bug, and then he would announce it publicly. 

I hate to do this to you, but can you help me again? You were successful in finding the first bug - but based on what you told me that could only select data from the database and not update it, right? Or is that not the case?

Please look into this - if the hacker could do it, I'm sure you can too. Let's close this hole before his 7 day "grace period" expires.

Thanks!
